I am not the original author of this guide, but I recommend following this excellent guide by [mcombeau](https://github.com/mcombeau), which I have added to my repository.

However, I have made some modifications to this guide, which I will indicate with the note: "Edit bepoisso".

You can find all their networks at the bottom of each guide page and here:

The 42 project Born2beroot explores the fundamentals of system administration by inviting us to install and configure a virtual machine. By the end of this project, we will have learned about virtualization, partitioning schemes, LVM, command-line software, protocols such as SSH and the importance of securing a system thanks to sudo, firewalls and password policies.

## Status


## Pre-requisites
* [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (12.8 at the time of this writing).
* [Debian](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/) (11.2.0 at the time of this writing).
* Enough free disk space.

## Guides

The most interesting part of any project is the research that goes behind it. If you are a student, please don't miss out on that opportunity by simply following guides such as these. In any case, they should under no circumstances be your only source of information about this project. Try things, fail, research, try again and succeed! And maybe write your own guide about it. Writing really is the best way to learn.

That said, I hope these guides can be useful if you're stuck or simply curious to see how someone else did it.
